# MUSE
MUSE is a project for Purdue University course of ECE362. It is a electric piano keyboard embedded in a STM32f051.

## Main Feature
 - The electric piano has two ocatives, and has 15 white keys with 10 black keys in total.
 - The electric piano has chord, which means you can put down different buttons at the same time.
 - The electric piano...polyphonic wave...

## Note
 - The body case can be done by different means; for instance, we used a lazor cutter to cut a piece of wood board for making a case.
 - The keyboard was 3D-printed, and it is helpful to check out the OKAY 2 Synth keyboard for reference.
 - The circuit design includes an Eagle version and an Altium version; the Altium version is a more sophisticated version in terms of its design.
 
## Build & Test
 - This project is developed on System Workbench for STM32.
 - To test the project, first build within Workbench, and then hit "Run".
 - A builded breadboard circuit is needed for testing; users can refer to dianlutu.sch for circuit building.
